I'm Reza Tavakoli - a PhD student in Economics at Virginia Tech University. I have a keen interest in using various tools to answer serious questions. Through this blog, I will be sharing material related to introducing different kinds of econometric and machine learning methods, using these methods to answer important questions that matter.
